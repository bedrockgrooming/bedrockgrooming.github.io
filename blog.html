    <p style="font-size: large;padding-right: 18%;">When it comes to insurance fraud, false rock attack allegations may
       not be the first culprit that comes to mind. However, in Albuquerque, 
       New Mexico, it's concerningly common. Our story starts with Iggy, an 
      adorable domesticated igneous rock belonging to a family of four in 
      Southern Albuquerque. The family's day-to-day life was brought to a 
      halt when their neighbors falsely claimed to have been attacked by Iggy 
      on Iggy's lawn. Once the neighbors filed a lawsuit against Iggy's 
      family for the alleged attack, all hope seemed to be lost until a 
      witness who was remotely working for Bedrock Grooming came forth. This 
      witness happened to be across the street from Iggy's family and had 
      Ring doorbell camera footage clearly showing that the attack didn't 
      occur. This evidence stood rock-solid in the case and Iggy was cleared 
      of any attacks against their neighbors. The Bedrock Grooming employee, 
      Simon Hockin, humbly stated that Iggy's family would've done the same 
      for him if they were in his shoes.</p>
      
    <h2>Emotional Support Rocks Gaining Popularity</h2>
    <div>
    <img src="Images/disabled.jpg" alt="disabledperson" width="60%" height="100%">

    <i>Aug 31, 2023</i>
    <p style="font-size: large;padding-right: 18%;">In Las Cruces, New Mexico's disabled community, cats and dogs aren't 
      the only pets owned for emotional assistance. Local business, Bedrock 
      Grooming, have began training Gneiss and Shale rocks to assist the 
      disabled in an experimental attempt to expand their business. 
      Scientists at Bedrock Grooming have carefully picked these types of 
      rocks for their gentle nature and their phenomenal intelligence. With 
      outstandingly positive feedback from the disabled community, their 
      attempt has been made a great success with many owners of the 
      emotional support rocks claiming to have made lifelong friends with 
      the rocks during the first week of owning them.</p>
      
    <h2>Traces of Organic Material Found in Roswell Meteorite Point to Aliens</h2>
    <img src="Images/alien.jpg" alt="alienrock" width="60%" height="100%">
    <div>
    <i>Aug 31, 2023</i>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: large;padding-right: 18%;">On August 28, 2023, a golf ball-sized meteorite landed in a field in 
      Roswell, New Mexico. After dating the meteorite and running tests, 
      researchers from New Mexico State University discovered that the 
      meteorite was made up of organic material from beyond this world. 
      Could these be the remains of a fallen alien civilization and a sign 
      of things to come?</p>
