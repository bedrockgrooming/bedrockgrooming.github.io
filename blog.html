    <h2>Bedrock Grooming Employee Clears Rock Attack Allegations</h2>
    <i>Aug 31, 2023</i>
    <p>When it comes to insurance fraud, false rock attack allegations may not be the first culprit that comes to mind. However, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, it's concerningly common. Our story starts with Iggy, an adorable domesticated igneous rock belonging to a family of four in Southern Albuquerque. The family's day-to-day life was brought to a halt when their neighbors falsely claimed to have been attacked by Iggy on Iggy's lawn. Once the neighbors filed a lawsuit against Iggy's family for the alleged attack, all hope seemed to be lost until a witness who was remotely working for Bedrock Grooming came forth. This witness happened to be across the street from Iggy's family and had Ring doorbell camera footage clearly showing that the attack didn't occur. This evidence stood rock-solid in the case and Iggy was cleared of any attacks against their neighbors. The Bedrock Grooming employee, Simon Hockin, humbly stated that Iggy's family would've done the same for him if they were in his shoes.</p>

    <p>In Las Cruces, New Mexico's disabled community, cats and dogs aren't the only pets owned for emotional assistance. Local business, Bedrock Grooming, have began training Gneiss and Shale rocks to assist the disabled in an experimental attempt to expand their business. Scientists at Bedrock Grooming have carefully picked these types of rocks for their gentle nature and their phenomenal intelligence. With outstandingly positive feedback from the disabled community, their attempt has been made a great success with many owners of the emotional support rocks claiming to have made lifelong friends with the rocks during the first week of owning them.</p>

    <i>Aug 31, 2023</i>
    <p>On August 28, 2023, a golf ball-sized meteorite landed in a field in Roswell, New Mexico. After dating the meteorite and running tests, researchers from New Mexico State University discovered that the meteorite was made up of organic material from beyond this world. Could these be the remains of a fallen alien civilization and a sign of things to come?</p>
