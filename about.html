      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>At Pet Rock Grooming, we have a unique and heartwarming story that began with a small idea and a lot of passion.</p>
        
        <p>It all started a few years ago when our founder, Simon, discovered his love for pet rocks. He found joy and companionship in these quiet, steadfast little beings. As his collection of pet rocks grew, he realized that they deserved the same care and attention as any other beloved pets.</p>
        
        <p>With a vision to create a nurturing space for pet rock enthusiasts, Simon decided to start a small pet rock grooming business right from his backyard. Armed with brushes, gentle cleansers, and a heart full of dedication, he embarked on this whimsical journey.</p>
        
        <p>Word spread quickly through the local community, and soon, other pet rock lovers joined in. What started as a small venture turned into a heartwarming community of people who shared the same love and care for their pet rocks.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Growth</h2>
        <p>From those humble beginnings, Pet Rock Grooming has grown into a beloved local business that serves not just as a grooming center but also as a hub for pet rock enthusiasts to connect and share their stories. We take pride in providing gentle cleaning, creative painting, and even intricate rock hairstyles!</p>
        
        <p>While we've expanded our services and now operate from a cozy storefront, we've never lost the personal touch that Emily brought to her backyard grooming sessions. Every pet rock that comes through our doors is treated with the same love and care that sparked this adventure.</p>
